// By default, values are immutable in Lapsang. However, at times, it makes
// sense to enable a value to hold state, and thus be able to change over
// time. Likewise, some methods have to cause side effects to interact with 
// the world outside the application. Such mutable values can be specifically 
// composed via the mutableValue typedef.
